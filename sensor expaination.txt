Sensor details:
--the photo diode is connected in reverse saturation and NIR diode in forward bias
--the reverse current from phtodiode varies with light intensity from NIR diode
--the cureent is converted to proportional voltage using op-amp in current-voltage stage
--capacitor acts to increase bandwith of values measured
--"Vf"==-"If"x"Rf"
--Voltage sampled is in analog which is converted to digital on ESP8266 
OP-AMP:
--PIN-6 : FEEDBACK LOOP THROUGH 8.2K AND 1uF CAPACITOR
--PIN-4 AND 3 : GROUND
--PIN-2 : TAKES FEEDBACK FROM PIN-6 AND CURRENT FROM CATHODE OF PHTODIODE
--PIN-7 : Vcc

NIR DIODE(D1, FORWARD BIASED):
--CONNECT ANODE TO Vcc
--CONNECT CATHODE TO GROUND

PHOTODIODE(D2, REVERSE BIASED):
--CONNECT CATHODE TO Vcc
--CONNECT ANODE TO GROUND

WIFI MODULE:
--PIN-2 : ADC PIN, TAKES OUTPUT FROM OPAMP PIN-6
